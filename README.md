# Discord AutoMod Custom Lists
## WARNING: NSFW
*These txt files contain strong swears and slurs. You have been warned.*

These are custom lists I've compiled from various sources, as a replacement for the built-in lists Discord provides. A few of the built-in lists are too restrictive, blocking phrases like "to f\*ck" and other arbitrary phrases within their severe profanity category. 

## Discord Warnings list
This uses Discord's built-in Insults & Slurs and Sexual Content lists. It only sends a warning log message to a moderator channel, but doesn not block the message from being sent in chat.

## Bad Words list
This list blocks the message from being sent, and also logs the message in the moderator channel.

## Sexual (Horny) Words list
Similar to the Bad Words list, this blocks the message from being sent, and also logs the message in the moderator channel.

## Custom Warnings list
This is a custom list of messages that will be flagged and send a warning log to the moderator channel, but does not block the message from being sent in chat.

## Bad Links list
This utilizes the regex function of the custom word lists, blocking spoofed links using the Fancy Markdown.
